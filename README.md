**BROOKLYN BALL CO**
A coding challenge for MightyHive by Shalin Scupham

**Features**
Persistent cookies for random a-b testing of Ball Is Life™ red/blue ball sales campaign

Hand-crafted cookie setter/getter library in vanilla JS, with default persistence to end of 32 bit epoch time

Pseudo-random GUID setter (as random at Math.random())

User activity persisted in Firebase

Minimal cart implementation, clickthrough tracking

Report page broken out by user, with conversion rates and total view stats

Minimal yet functional styling for the modern era

Logo for Brooklyn Ball Co™ is animated and subtly references Pokeball for enhanced appeal to millennials

**Todos**
-Add timestamp and IP info by user visit

-Associate GUID's with IP addresses, FB/Google tracking pixels to circumvent paranoid users with "privacy concerns" who've disabled cookies

-Add information about ball color to cart state

-Stripe integration, Facebook ad campaign to widen sales funnel and increase profitability
