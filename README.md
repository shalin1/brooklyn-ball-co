**BROOKLYN BALL CO**
A coding challenge for MightyHive by Shalin Scupham

**Features**
-Random a-b testing of Ball Is Life™ red/blue ball sales campaign

-Modification of copy and imagery based on React state, persisted between visits via cookie.

-Hand-crafted cookie setter/getter library in vanilla JS, with default persistence to end of 32 bit epoch time, tested for cross-browser compatibility

-Pseudo-random GUID setter (as random at Math.random())

-User activity and statistics persisted in Firebase

-Minimal cart implementation, clickthrough tracking

-Report page broken out by user, with conversion rates and total view stats

-Minimal yet functional styling for the modern era

-Logo for Brooklyn Ball Co™ is animated and subtly references Pokeball for enhanced appeal to millennials

**Todos**
-Add testing suite to facilitate feature development

-Refactor firebase transaction calls in to helper library for DRYer codebase

-Refactor meta info in to new slice of firebase DB

-Add timestamp and IP info by user visit

-Associate GUID's with IP addresses, FB/Google tracking pixels to circumvent paranoid users with "privacy concerns" who've disabled cookies

-Tidy up CSS to help future developers-- refactor with Sass 7:1 pattern

-Responsive design breakpoints

-Add information about ball color to cart state

-Stripe integration, Facebook ad campaign to widen sales funnel and increase profitability
